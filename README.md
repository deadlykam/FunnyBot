#### Set Credentials
After starting the software you will need to provide your twitter developer's consumer key, consumer secret, access token and access token secret. You can find your twitter credentials in your [twitter developer's page](https://developer.twitter.com/). In the FunnyBot software open the credentials settings from _Edit/Credentials_ menu. Here write down the consumer key, consumer secret, access token and access token secret. After giving the credentials press the _Set_ button and close the _Credential Setting_.

#### Set Tweets
Next you need to set the tweets that you want the bot to send. Open the tweet menu from _Edit/Tweets_. In the tweet menu give the _Start Message_ and _End Message_ tweets. Then type the tweet in _Enter Tweet_ box. once you are satisfied with the tweet then press the _Add Tweet_ button to add the tweet to the bot tweet listing. If you want you can add as much tweet as you want. All the tweets add will be shown on the table below. Once you are done add the tweets press the _Set_ button and close the menu. In the main menu the tweets red light will turn green indicating that tweets have been given.

#### Set Timer
Now you need to set the time cycle for your tweets. The time cycle will determine after how long will the bot send a tweet. You must make sure you have enough tweets that can be sent in a day, if not then the bot won't send any more tweets and will be waiting for the next day for refreshing the tweets.
_tw = tweet, tc = time cycle_

##### Best example:
###### Bot Setting -> _tw > tc_
If you set more than 24 tweets and give time cycle to 1 hour then the tweet posting rate will be 1 tweet per hour which means some of the tweets will be tweeted with in 24 hours in random order. After 24 hours the tweets will refresh meaning the bot will have all the tweets back again. This ensures a little bit of uniqueness to the bot because it have lot of tweets to choose from in a day and reduces repetition of the tweets.

##### Good example:
###### Bot Setting -> _1 : 1_
If you set 24 tweets and give time cycle to 1 hour then the tweet posting rate will be 1 tweet per hour which means all tweets will be tweeted with in 24 hours in random order. After 24 hours the tweets will refresh meaning the bot will have tweets to tweet again. This will not make the bot look unique because it will be repeating the tweets again.

##### Bad example:
###### Bot Setting -> _tw < tc_
If you set less than 24 tweets and give time cycle to 1 hour then the tweeting posting rate will be 1 tweet per hour which means the bot will not have enough tweets to tweet with in 24 hours. When this happens the bot will wait for the tweets to be refreshed after 24 hours so that it can use the tweets again. This will not make the bot look unique because it will be repeating the tweets again.

After understanding how the _tweet/time cycle_ works now you need to set the time cycle. Open timer menu from _Edit/Set Timer_. Give the the time cycle here and press the _Set_ button. In the main menu the timer red light will turn green indicating that timer have been given.

#### Set Log Path _(Optional)_
This part is optional. The default path on the log files is in the System's document location and the files are called _Fail.txt_ and _Success.txt_. _Fail.txt_ contains all the events that have been failed and _Success.txt_ contains all the events that were successful. You can also open the file location from the software from _File/Open Log_, this will open a folder where these files are located. 

If you want you can change the Log path, to do so you need to open _Edit/Log Path_ and choose the folder destination for the Log path and press the _Open_ button.

#### Starting The Bot
Once you have followed all of the above steps then now finally is the time to start the bot. To start the bot go to _Bot/Start_. This will turn the Start light from red to green, indicating that the bot has started. All the tweets that have been tweeted can be seen in the table in the main menu. This table will also show if there are any errors for example if the credentials given are wrong. The bot will now tweet in the given intervals and will only stop when you stop the bot.
